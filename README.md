## Overview 
This is a web app where we can find all the informations about the evolution of the Covid in the world.

We collect the data from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ by using a web scraping with Beautiful Soup 4 of Python.

And after that we use Dash to visualize the informations.

You can see how we work by opening the Dashboard.py file .
